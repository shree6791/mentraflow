# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FINAL RESULT: Cards now display ALL metadata (status chip, countdown chip, filename, Summary link, Score link) in ONE horizontal row, with only title above and primary action button below. Total vertical space reduction: ~60% compared to original layout. Cards are extremely scannable while retaining all information."

    - message: "✅ LAZY LOADING ARCHITECTURE TESTING COMPLETE - ALL 8 ENDPOINTS VERIFIED\n\n**Review Request Completed:**\nTested all backend API endpoints with the new lazy loading architecture as requested. Backend URL: https://memoryflow-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api\n\n**Architecture Changes Verified:**\n- NODES are now lean (metadata only) with quizId and summaryId references ✅\n- Quiz content stored in quiz_data.py and loaded on-demand ✅\n- Summary content stored in summary_data.py and loaded on-demand ✅\n\n**Critical Endpoints Tested & Results:**\n1. GET /api/nodes ✅ - Returns lightweight nodes WITHOUT quiz/summary content (LAZY LOADING VERIFIED)\n2. GET /api/node/Forgetting%20Curve ✅ - Lazy loads quiz (2 questions) and summary from separate files\n3. GET /api/node/Active%20Recall ✅ - Second lazy loading test confirms architecture works for all nodes\n4. GET /api/stats ✅ - Statistics still work correctly\n5. GET /api/library ✅ - Library items still work correctly\n6. GET /api/recall-tasks ✅ - Recall tasks still work correctly\n7. GET /api/clusters ✅ - Clusters still work correctly\n8. GET /api/recommendations ✅ - Recommendations still work correctly\n\n**Key Verification Points Confirmed:**\n✅ Lazy loading: /api/nodes returns lean data without quiz/summary\n✅ On-demand loading: /api/node/{title} fetches quiz/summary from separate files\n✅ All derived data functions still work correctly\n✅ No performance degradation\n✅ Quiz questions have proper structure: q, options, correctIndex\n✅ Summary has proper structure: content, keyTakeaways, keywords\n\n**Expected Result Achieved:**\nAll endpoints work correctly with new architecture. Lazy loading reduces initial data transfer while maintaining full functionality when details are needed.\n\n**Backend Status:** New lazy loading architecture is production-ready. All endpoints working perfectly with the new structure. No issues found."

    - message: "✅ NAMING CONVENTION REFACTOR TESTING COMPLETE - ALL 8 ENDPOINTS PASSED\n\n**Review Request Completed:**\nTested all backend API endpoints with the new naming convention refactor as requested. Backend URL: https://memoryflow-4.preview.emergentagent.com/api\n\n**Naming Convention Changes Verified:**\n✅ LIBRARY_ITEMS renamed to DOCUMENTS\n✅ Document IDs: 'lib1' → 'doc1', 'lib2' → 'doc2', etc.\n✅ NODES: libraryId → docId\n✅ NODES: quizId values changed from 't1' → 'q1', 't2' → 'q2', etc.\n✅ NODES: summaryId values changed from 't1' → 's1', 't2' → 's2', etc.\n✅ QUIZ_CONTENT: keys changed from 't1' → 'q1', 't2' → 'q2', etc.\n✅ SUMMARY_CONTENT: keys changed from 't1' → 's1', 't2' → 's2', etc.\n\n**Critical Endpoints Tested & Results:**\n1. GET /api/nodes ✅ - Lightweight structure verified\n2. GET /api/node/Forgetting%20Curve ✅ - Lazy loading with new IDs (docId=doc1, quizId=q1, summaryId=s1)\n3. GET /api/node/Active%20Recall ✅ - Second test (docId=doc2, quizId=q2, summaryId=s2)\n4. GET /api/library ✅ - DOCUMENTS with new IDs (doc1-doc8)\n5. GET /api/stats ✅ - Still works after refactor\n6. GET /api/recall-tasks ✅ - Still works after refactor\n7. GET /api/clusters ✅ - Still works after refactor\n8. GET /api/recommendations ✅ - Still works after refactor\n\n**Key Verification Points Confirmed:**\n✅ New naming convention: docId, q1-q8 (quiz), s1-s8 (summary), doc1-doc8 (documents)\n✅ Lazy loading still functional with new IDs\n✅ All derived data still working\n✅ More intuitive and relatable ID naming\n\n**Expected Result Achieved:**\nAll endpoints work with new naming convention. IDs are more semantic and easier to understand (q for quiz, s for summary, doc for documents).\n\n**Backend Status:** Naming convention refactor is production-ready. All endpoints working perfectly with the new semantic ID structure. No issues found."
