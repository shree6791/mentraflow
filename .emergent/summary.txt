The previous AI engineer diligently evolved the MentraFlow application, significantly enhancing its frontend UI/UX and core functionality. Initially, the work focused on rectifying a non-opening Library Item Detail Modal within the Dashboard, which was ultimately found to be functional. Subsequent efforts centered on implementing a Generated Content Modal to provide visual feedback for newly created summaries and quizzes.

A major focus was the iterative redesign of the Dashboard layout, transitioning from a two-column structure to a user-centric Smart Priority Flow single-column design. This involved replacing a collapsible capture widget with a Floating Action Button (FAB) for knowledge capture, adding pagination to the Knowledge Library and Priority sections, and incorporating numerous UI/UX polish items like retention indicators, progress rings, and tooltips. Recurring challenges included persistent alignment issues and spacing problems, particularly within the quick filters and library cards, which the engineer was actively addressing at the point the trajectory concluded. The project demonstrates a strong emphasis on user feedback and iterative refinement.

<product_requirements>
MentraFlow is an MVP designed for memory enhancement, featuring conversion-optimized landing pages and a functional dashboard. The application adheres to a strict brand system, incorporating specific colors (Deep Teal, Mind Blue, Neuro Yellow, Neural Coral, Retention Green, Deep Indigo), Poppins/Inter fonts, glass-morphism, and neural-network animations. Key pages include Home, Science, Vision, Contact, Login, Dashboard, and Pricing. Paramount requirements include responsive design, consistent typography, spacing, and mobile-friendly carousels for card sections. A light/dark mode theme has been implemented but is currently hidden. The Dashboard was initially redesigned into a Priority Dashboard with a two-column layout, Knowledge Library, Recall Tasks, Capture Knowledge, progress tracking, and an interactive Knowledge Graph. The user's explicit goal is to make the dashboard the most user-friendly app ever to improve post-learning retention, shifting it from a passive library to an active learning coach that guides users. Recent work has focused on improving visual feedback, decluttering the interface, and enhancing cognitive aspects for better user guidance and engagement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding visual clutter and spacing. The user reported that the quick filters in My Knowledge Library () had poor spacing and were out of order. Additionally, the library cards themselves feel off.. too much color.. or too much space.. long banner.. its not giving thr righ feel.

The AI engineer's last explicit action was to fix the filter button spacing again, indicating Edit was successful. This implies a modification to  to adjust , , and  properties for the filter buttons and their container. The engineer was in the process of addressing these issues, confirming the user's observations, and had just completed an edit related to filter spacing. The next planned action was to declutter the library cards.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to properly fix the quick filters spacing and then declutter the library cards by making visual adjustments and possibly removing redundant information.
